# Financial Document Analysis System (OCR-based)

##  Project Overview
This project extracts structured information from unstructured financial documents
(like invoices) using OCR and rule-based text processing.

The system converts invoice text into structured JSON data that can be
used for analysis and validation.

---

##  Objectives
- Extract key invoice fields (bill number, date, totals)
- Handle OCR noise and missing data safely
- Validate financial consistency (subtotal + tax = total)
- Generate structured JSON output

##  File-wise Explanation

### ocr_test.py
Main entry point of the system.
Controls the complete workflow:
- Reads OCR text
- Cleans the text
- Extracts invoice fields
- Validates totals
- Saves output to JSON

---

### utils.py
Contains reusable helper functions:
- clean_text() → cleans OCR noise
- safe_value() → handles missing values safely

---

### extractor.py
Responsible for extracting invoice fields using regex:
- Bill number
- Invoice date
- Subtotal
- Tax amount
- Grand total

---

### validator.py
Contains business rules:
- Validates subtotal + tax against grand total
- Reports validation issues

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Activate virtual environment
2. Place OCR output in `raw_ocr.txt`
3. Run the main script:

```bash
python ocr_test.py



##The system generates a structured JSON output:

{
  "bill_number": "77821",
  "invoice_date": "12-08-2025",
  "subtotal": 98850,
  "tax_amount": 17793,
  "grand_total": 116643,
  "validation": {
    "total_match": true,
    "issues": []
  }}
  ## 🔄 Workflow Explanation

1. Invoice text is provided as OCR output.
2. Text is cleaned to remove noise and unwanted characters.
3. Required invoice fields are extracted using regex rules.
4. Extracted values are validated using business logic.
5. Final structured data is saved as JSON output.
